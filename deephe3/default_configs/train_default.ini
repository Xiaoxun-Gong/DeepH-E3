; =============================
; 
; Explanation of target_blocks
; 
; For example, the compound MoS2 has two types of elements: Mo(42) and S(16). The orbital types of Mo and S are [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2] and [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] respectively (this can be found in orbital_types.dat in processed structure folder). This means, The number of atomic orbitals for Molybdenum is 7, containing three S orbitals, two P orbitals and two D orbitals. Similar for the element Sulphur. 
; 
; Suppse we set target_blocks to
; [{"42 42": [3, 5]}]
; This means, when the net sees a hopping matrix between Mo and Mo, it only takes out the hopping between the orbital of Mo which has index 3 (i.e. the first P orbital) and the orbital of Mo which has index 5 (i.e. the first D orbital). The predicted matrix size is thus (2x1+1)x(2x2+1) = 3x5. Other types of hopping (e.g. Mo-S, S-Mo, S-S) are not trained.
; 
; If the target is set to be
; [{"42 42": [3, 5], "42 16": [3, 4], "16 42": [2, 5], "16 16": [2, 4]}]
; Then 4 types of hopping are trained together. Specifically, these are: hopping from 1st P orbital of Mo to 1st D orbital of Mo, 1st P orbital of Mo to 1st D orbital of S, 1st P orbital of S to 1st D orbital of Mo, 1st P orbital of S to 1st orbital of S. These orbitals will be predicted in the same output channel.
; 
; If the target is set to be
; [{"42 42": [3, 5], "42 16": [3, 4], "16 42": [2, 5], "16 16": [2, 4]}, {"42 16": [3, 2]}]
; In addition to the orbitals described above, the new dict in the list {"42 16": [3, 2]} introduces a new independent channel in the output. This channel predicts the hopping from the 1st P orbital of Mo to the 1st P orbital of S.
; 
; Note that the angular quantum numbers should always be the same for orbitals predicted in the same channel, or error will be thrown out.
